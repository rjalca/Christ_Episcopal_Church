				<h2>Site Intent</h2>
				
					<p>The redesign of Christ Episcopal Church's website will be focused on creating a modern, organized website
					catering to the needs and desires of the targeted audience. The plan includes having a structured navigation
					system to assist in the ease of use for the site's visitors. The redesigned website will also include a logo
					to represent the goals of the church.</p>

				<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
					
					<p>The three main churches found through a google search of churches in Seattle, Washington are Mars Mill
					Church, The City Church, and Seattle Baptist Church. According to research from Alexa (The Web Information
					Company), these three churches' main browsers are males from ages 25 to 34 years with a college education.
					Their websites are a complete contrast to that of Christ Episcopal Church's website which seems to target
					an older group of christians</p>
